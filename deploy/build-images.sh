# differing only in which Mateu frontend artifact the build puts on the classpath. consoles/shell
# builds ec-demo1-shell by default and ec-demo1-shell-redwood with -Predwood (control-shell the

# deploy/manifests/31-shell-redwood.yaml.

# Docker Hub, Keycloak from Quay, Postgres and Redpanda from their own registries.

  # Built outside the image on purpose: the Dockerfiles copy target/*.jar, so Maven's cache works
  # and a code change does not re-resolve the whole dependency tree.
  #
  # `clean` is not paranoia, and it is the expensive half of that trade for a reason.
  #
  # Mateu's annotation processor writes the bootstrap page's controller into
  # target/generated-sources, and Maven does NOT re-run it when the only thing that changed is
  # `mateu.version`: the module's own .java files are untouched, so javac skips the round and the
  # PREVIOUS Mateu's generated controller survives into the jar. An image built that way carries a
  # new frontend bundle behind an old bootstrap.
  #
  # That is not hypothetical. It shipped: a fix released in alpha.308 was still missing from a
  # console running alpha.309, and the symptoms were a body with the browser's default 8px margin,
  # an app sitting that far down its viewport, the chat panel's input bar hanging off the bottom
  # edge, and menus that did not resolve. Every build was green throughout, and so was the obvious
  # check — "all eight modules compile" is true and says nothing whatever about whether the
  # processor ran again. What says it is a clean build of the same pom producing a different
  # generated controller.
  #
  # The same holds, and matters more, between the two renderers of one shell: the second build of
  # a module reuses the first one's target/ unless it is cleaned, and a Redwood image built on a
  # Vaadin build's leftovers is a Vaadin image with a Redwood name. So every renderer's build
  # is a `clean package` of its own, immediately followed by its image.
