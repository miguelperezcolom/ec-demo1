# Takes ec1 back to before anything was integrated, to walk the onboarding again step by step:
#   - the services lose what the integration made: reservations, integrations (crs-pms and pms-fo, with
#     the pms-fo cursor), mappings, the MDM's customers, the front office's guests, stays and the PMS
#     catalogue it was given, notifications, the reception notices, audit, the engine's processes;
#   - what is set up, not integrated, stays: the ERP's partners, the front office's rooms and
#     catalogs, the registration rules, the process definitions, content, users and Keycloak;
#   - Salesforce loses every contact and the MDM's Cases (change requests and reception notices: a
#     contact with a Case cannot be deleted).
# Opera is not touched, and never cleaned: what earlier runs wrote stays there. So each run gets a
# context of its own for the CRS locator in the reservations' external references — ECDEMO1-<MMddHHmm>,
# UTC, in the ec-demo-run ConfigMap — and a new random locator that repeats an old one does not find,
# and update, an old run's reservation. Within a run the integration still finds what it wrote by
# locator (under the run's context), so walking the onboarding again writes no reservation twice.
# Partners are found by their CorporateId and guest profiles through their reservation: no context.
# The run's reservations also carry it as Opera's «Custom Reference» (OPERA_CUSTOM_REFERENCE, same
# ConfigMap): a pms-fo integration of the default scope, CHAIN, brings to the front office only those.
#
# The demo's baseline is left alone, but reset.sh would bring the old state back: take a new one
# with snapshot.sh once the onboarding has been walked again.
