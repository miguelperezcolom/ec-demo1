# Takes ec1's demo back to its baseline (snapshot.sh). What it does, in order:
#   1. notes which customers and change requests ec1 has now, to know what the demo created;
#   2. stops the services and the engine;
#   3. restores the services' databases and the engine's state tables;
#   4. Salesforce: deletes the contacts and Cases the demo created (ec1's only — the org is shared
#      with the local environment) and puts the baseline's contacts back as they were;
#   5. the MDM resumes Salesforce's events from now: the demo's are not replayed;
#   6. puts back the Opera context the baseline's reservations were written under (ec-demo-run);
#   7. starts everything again.
# Opera is not touched: nothing is cancelled or deleted there. The demo is built to repeat on top of
# what it wrote (see docs/poc-acl/demo.md, «Resetear la demo»). A baseline taken before the context
# was saved with it was written under ECDEMO1.
