/**
 * What the pms-fo integration tells a hotel's front office: the stays as the PMS holds them, and the
 * PMS's catalogue the front office reads them with. Sent on the {@code front-office-commands} topic and
 * taken once — the front office deduplicates on {@link #commandId()}, and a stay is written by state,
 * never by increments, so taking the same one twice leaves the front office as taking it once.
 *
 * <p>The front office consumes the PMS (the chain CRS → PMS → front office): nothing here comes from
 * the CRS. Codes are the PMS's own; the front office turns them into words with the catalogue the
 * same integration gave it ({@link ReplaceCatalogue}).
