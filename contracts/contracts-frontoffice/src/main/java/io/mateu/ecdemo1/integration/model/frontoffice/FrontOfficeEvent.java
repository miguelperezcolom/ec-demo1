/**
 * What happened at a hotel's reception, as the front office says it: a guest checked in, checked out,
 * or never came; the desk charged something to the stay's folio, or took a charge back. The PMS is the master of the stay, so what the desk did goes UP to it: the pms-fo
 * integration takes these from the {@code front-office-events} topic and starts the process that
 * records it in the PMS («registrar-checkin», «registrar-checkout», «registrar-no-show-pms»). Written
 * to the front office's outbox in the transaction of the desk's decision; the consumer deduplicates on
 * {@link #eventId()}, and the engine on the process key, so taking one twice records it once.
 *
 * <p>Every event names the stay both ways: the front office's own id and hotel (the CRS's code), the
 * CRS's locator when the reservation came from the CRS (null for one born in the PMS, or a walk-in the
 * CRS has not booked yet), and the PMS reservation when the front office has it linked (null for a
 * walk-in that has not reached the PMS yet: the PMS side finds it by the CRS locator, or waits for it).
