/**
 * The one page a user ever loads.
 *
 * <p>Everything below the menu bar is served by another pod: each {@link RemoteMenu} names a
 * path, the gateway routes that path to the app that owns it, and the shell renders whatever
 * menu that app declares. So the orchestrator, the forms engine and the three demo
 * services keep their own UIs — nothing about them is restated here — and the shell only has to
 * know where they live. Adding one is a field below, a route in the gateway and a manifest; the
 * path in all three has to match the {@code @UI} value the service itself declares.
 *
 * <p>The Keycloak URL is baked in at compile time: Mateu writes {@code @KeycloakSecured} into
 * the generated bootstrap page, so it cannot be an environment variable yet. Changing the
 * deployment's hostname means rebuilding this image.
 *
 * <p><b>Two renderers, one class.</b> The same module builds the Vaadin console (ec-demo1-shell) and,
 * with {@code -Predwood}, the Redwood one (ec-demo1-shell-redwood): {@code io.mateu:redwood} in
 * place of {@code io.mateu:vaadin-lit}, and nothing else about it is renderer-aware. That is the
 * point being demonstrated — a {@link RemoteMenu} carries UIDL rather than HTML, so the
 * orchestrator, the forms engine and the demo services render through whichever renderer the shell
 * loaded, with no change on any of them. The two run BESIDE each other, because side by side
 * against one cluster is the demonstration. No Keycloak client for the Redwood one:
 * {@code @KeycloakSecured} names the Keycloak URL, not this app's host, so the demo client serves
 * both — its redirect URIs list both hosts.
