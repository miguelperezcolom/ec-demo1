/**
 * What the connector writes to Opera the same way for every property. How to reach each property
 * — gateway, application key, client, secret, enterprise — is not here: it is each hotel's
 * integration's (see {@code Connections}).
 *
 * @param externalSystemCode the code Opera knows the CRS by: it qualifies every external reference
 *                           this adapter writes and searches by
 * @param versionUdf         the numeric UDF of the reservation that carries the CRS version written
 *                           — the order guard (HLA R18, R28)
 * @param payAtHotelMethod   the payment method a reservation with no payment is recorded with.
 *                           Opera requires one; the CRS has none for "pays at the desk"
 * @param crmExternalSystem  the context of the guest profile's reference to its customer in the MDM —
 *                           the AF's «External Reference ID (Type: CRM)», the CRM_GUID. Blank: not stamped
 * @param profileReferences  whether guest profiles carry external references at all. A tenant takes
 *                           them only for external systems configured as interfaces of the property
 *                           (else 400 OPERAWS-GEN01187); without them, a reservation's guest profile is
 *                           found through the reservation, by the CRS locator it does carry
 * @param postDeposits       whether the payments the central office collected are posted to the
 *                           reservation's folio. Posting needs a cashier, and OPERA takes it from the
 *                           integration user's configuration (else 400 FOF00094 «Invalid Cashier»);
 *                           off, they stay in the CRS and the reservation is written without them
 * @param knownProperties    the chain's properties, named here rather than listed by the tenant: a
 *                           client without access to the hub gets 403 asking for the list. Each is read
 *                           on its own — which a client of the property may do — for its name
 * @param customReference    what every reservation this adapter writes carries in Opera's «Custom
 *                           Reference»: a search filter in Opera's reservation list, so the desk can
 *                           find the integration's reservations. Blank: not written
